# asana-json2csv

a simple script to transform an asana produced json file into a csv file

---

at Leaf we use [Asana](https://www.asana.com/) to keep track of a lot of things, some of which get crunched into Pivot Tables of their own to provide us with the information that we need to kick ass.

this is a simple script that takes a json file (`data.json`) and outputs a csv file (`out.csv`) with from the tasks and sub-tasks.

this csv has the bare minimum that we need to get our pivot tables singing.

hope this helps anyone out there trying to squeeze a bit more out of Asana.
